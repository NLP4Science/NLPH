Corpora
=======

Text
----

* A large open-licensed corpus for Hebrew social media texts. What online site can be scraped? What is the status of adataset generated in this way? How it is anonimized?

Voice
-----

* Work together with Mozilla's `Common Voice Project <https://voice.mozilla.org/data>`_ to build a Hebrew voice dataset.


Linguistic Resources
=====================

Embeddings
----------

* An embedding for Hebrew words trained on something other than Wikipedia?


Code
====

* A web-based system for human tagging and labeling of texts.
